# Rock Paper Scissors

This is my implementation of the [Rock Paper Scissors Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors)
from the Java Script section of the Foundations course of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

In this project we have to recreate the classic game of [Rock Paper Scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors) in the Browser's Developer Console using JavaScript.

## How to play?
Open the console with the command ```CTRL + Shift + I``` or ```F12``` on Firefox, or ```CTRL + Shift + J``` on Chrome, and follow the instructions.

## Skills Used
 - JavaScript Basics
